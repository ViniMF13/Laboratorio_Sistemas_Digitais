# 🔐 **Digital Safe Lock System – RTL Design**

## 📖 Project Description  
This project implements a **digital electronic safe lock system**, designed using **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** methodology and described in **VHDL**. The system includes the following features:  

- ✅ **9-digit password input (36 bits)**
- ✅ Configurable **operation modes (4 bits)**
- ✅ **Temporary lock** after three failed attempts  
- ✅ **LED and 7-segment display** status indicators  
- ✅ **Locking motor control**  

---

## 📜 System Architecture  

📌 **High-Level FSM** – Models the system's behavior.  
📌 **Data Path Diagram** – Defines the interconnections between components.  
📌 **Controller Diagram** – Details the FSM states and transitions.  
📌 **VHDL Implementation** – RTL code for synthesis and simulation.
